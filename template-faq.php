						<h3>What are the basic ingredients in gelato?</h3>
						Gelato is made up of liquid(s) and solid raw ingredients, stabilizers, emulsifiers, flavor ingredients, air, and other ingredients.
						<h3>For example:</h3>
						<div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 100px;">
							<ul>
								<li><em>Liquid Raw Ingredients</em>: Water, milk, etc.</li>
								<li><em>Solid Raw Ingredients</em>: Sugars, fats, Milk Solids Non-Fat (MSNFs)</li>
								<li><em>Stabilizers</em>: Guar Gum, locust bean gum, etc.</li>
								<li><em>Emulsifiers</em>: Mono- and di-glycerides</li>
								<li><em>Flavor Ingredients</em>: Pastes, powders</li>
								<li><em>Air</em></li>
								<li><em>Other Ingredients</em>: Other ingredients: Mineral salts, cocoa products, dry fruit, toppings and fillings PreGel’s distinct <a href="https://products.pregelamerica.com/enpga/products/gelato-sorbetto/flavorings.html">flavoring pastes </a>are then added. 
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<h3>What is a Base?</h3>
						PreGel Bases are well-balanced essential ingredients in powdered form that promote the highest quality flavor, texture, and ease-of-use for gelato and ice cream production. The base is pivotal for creating a velvety structure and texture that allows for desirable creaminess and softness.
						<h3>What is a Stabilizer?</h3>
						There are two types of stabilizers used in gelato and ice cream. One comes from animal sources and the most commonly used is gelatin or eggs. The other stabilizer is a vegetable source such as carrageenan, guar gum and locust bean gum. Stabilizers are used in gelato and ice cream for a variety of reasons, as they increase viscosity, improve the smoothness of the product body, and prevent ice crystal formation and melting.
						<h3>What is Arabeschi<sup>&reg;</sup>?</h3>
						PreGel Arabeschi® is a topping and filling for gelato, sorbetto, ice cream, frozen yogurt, soft serve, pastry, and beverages. As a topping, it is used to enhance the decoration of desserts. As a filling, it adds extra flavor and textural components to desserts or savory items. Our Arabeschi® line encompasses a variety of flavors including rich milk and dark chocolate, as well as selectively sourced nut and fruit varieties.
						<h3>What is the difference between Hot and Cold Process?</h3>
						Hot Process requires the heating of liquids, whereas Cold Process does not. To find out more about these different processes, attend one of our <a href="https://pregel-itc.com/training/classes/">training classes</a>.
						<h3>How much flavor paste do I need to use? </h3>
						The amount of flavor paste for a standard 5-liter pan varies by recipe. PreGel hosts a helpful <a href="http://www.pregelrecipes.com">recipe database</a>, where a variety of recipe books can be downloaded. You can also request that your dedicated sales consultant or special services representative email your desired recipe book choice. For special batches, please contact our <a href="https://pregel-itc.com/training">International Training Centers</a>.
						<h3>What is the stocking temperature? </h3>
						The stocking temperature in a freezer should be around -17.8˚C/-0.04˚F
						<h3>What temperature does gelato have to be once it comes out of the batch freezer? </h3>
						Temperatures should range between -7.8˚ to -5˚C/18˚F to 23˚F. At this point just 50-60 percent of water is frozen.
						<h3>How long can I keep my gelato in the display case for?</h3>
						We suggest anywhere from 3-5 days, however, this answer can slightly vary depending on various factors during preparation and if you are storing your gelato in a freezer overnight. A longer shelf-life may be achieved by preparing your gelato via Hot Process. 
						<h3>How do you present gelato?</h3>
						There are three ways to present gelato. We suggest sculpted, flat, or mounds, and always showcased in a 5-liter pan. Gelato generally comes out of the batch freezer in a very natural way, and does not require much pressing or pushing. The result should be a very harmonious form. 
						<h3>How do you serve gelato? </h3>
						Gelato is served with spades or spatulas, which allow for it to take on more of an artisan appearance.
						<h3>Do you decorate gelato?</h3>
						Absolutely! Gelato is considered an artisan dessert which means the decoration is a large part of the whole ambiance of the gelato experience. PreGel’s Arabeschi® and Toppings are both used to decorate the finished product. Additionally, PreGel's <a href="https://products.pregelamerica.com/enpga/catalogsearch/result/index/?p=1&q=molds">molds</a> can be used to create mouthwatering gelato frozen pops, and more.  
						<h3>How long will my PreGel products last?</h3>
						PreGel products have a shelf-life of 2-3 years once produced – whether it’s been opened or not has no bearing on the shelf-life. Although, remember to keep products well-sealed and do not keep in extreme temperatures, as both can shorten the life span and reduce the quality of the product. The expiration date indicated on your packaging is in European form, which is day/month/year. If you have questions on the product life, contact our <a href="https://pregelamerica.com/contact/?lang=en">Special Service Team</a>.
						<h3>What should I do if a Paste, Arabeschi<sup>&reg;</sup> or Topping begins to separate (oil from paste)?</h3>
						This is generally true for most nut and chocolate products, as they carry natural oils within. To prevent separation, occasionally mix it like a soup. Shake toppings well.
						<h3>What is the nutritional content for my product?</h3>
						PreGel can only provide nutritional information for our ingredient solutions. If you want to assess the nutritional content for the finished product you provide, we recommend that you partner with a local testing lab that can accurately provide nutritional information on your product.
						<h3>At what temperature should ingredients be stored?</h3>
						All products should be stored between 15-20˚C/60-68˚F, with a relative humidity of 65% or less for best results.

													<h3>Is gelato a takeout business?</h3>
													PreGel generally promotes gelato as an experience and social activity to enjoy with family and friends outside of the home. However, we sell a variety of carryout containers so that you can allow your customers to take it home to share with the family.
													<h3>Can I use milk with the Super Sprints instead of water? How much?</h3>
													Yes, milk can be used instead of water in PreGel Super Sprints depending on the Super Sprint. Some require the addition of milk, while others require the addition of water. Generally, 2500 g/88.2 oz of liquid is added for gelato, and 3,000 g/105.8 oz of liquid is added for soft serve. Please consult our <a href="http://pregelrecipes.com/?=america&=america&lang=en">recipe database</a> or the product bag for information on which liquid to add and how much.
													<h3>Can I mix Traditional Pastes and Fortefrutto<sup>&reg;</sup> with Super Sprints?</h3>
													No. Traditional Pastes and Fortefrutto<sup>&reg;</sup> are the flavorings used in Hot Process and Cold Process to add to a mix of base, stabilizers and emulsifiers. Super Sprints are an instant, complete product that already contain the flavor, base, stabilizers and emulsifiers.
													<h3>What is the difference between PreGel's pistachio pastes?</h3>
													All of our pistachio pastes are high-quality and authentic, coming from a variety of regions throughout Italy and the Mediterranean.

													We offer two hazelnut options, Hazelnut Piemonte Traditional Paste (Dark Roasted Hazelnut) and Hazelnut Regina Traditional Paste (Premium Light Toasted Hazelnut). Hazelnut Piemonte is made with hazelnuts from the Piedmonte region of Italy and carries an authentic and roasted hazelnut taste. Hazelnut Regina is 100% pure hazelnut paste that boasts a fresh hazelnut flavor. Both are top quality pastes, it is your preference in terms of which you use.

													A popular Italian flavor, we carry three different chocolate hazelnut options. Chocolate-Hazelnut Traditional Paste combines milk chocolate with real hazelnut flavor, while Gianduia Traditional Paste (Dark Chocolate Hazelnut) combines dark chocolate with hazelnuts blended into the paste.
